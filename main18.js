    //Day 41
//high level for trees
//linked list => made up of nodes => each node has a value and pointer(next)

//NODE BASED STRUCTURES
//graphs=>nodes that can all be connected to each other
//eg: cities=>package from sf to atl taking different routes
    //cycles...

//trees=>heirarchal orginate and branch out (looks like upside down tree)
//og node is called 'root' node
//parent child relationships, parent child nodes, one to many relationship
//different kinds of trees
    //eg: heaps=> trees but keep stuff in order
    //eg: tries=> keeping words in order
    //eg: binary tree=> each node has max of 2 children/pointers
//linked list is like one dimensional tree
//binary trees help with => search algorithms, sorting algorithms, file systems

//DOM is a tree node structure! :O
