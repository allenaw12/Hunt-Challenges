<h1>Week 2 - Arrays!</h1>
<p>Hey everybody! Welcome to the first day of my second week of daily web dev challenges this October ðŸŽƒ.
    This week our challenges all deal with Arrays! Their purpose is to store a collection of things under a single reference name, but the way they are set up and used in JavaScript is a little different from other programming languages. If you're coming from a different language, be sure to check out what's different! While working on our challenges, feel free to use JavaScript's built-in Array methods.</p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>This week we'll be working with arrays toward a final puzzling result on Friday when we combine our daily functions. Your solutions should be built to work within any given daily constraints.
        Do you know how to compare arrays? Not sure? Don't worry, you'll figure it out...
        Today's task is to write a function that will check equality between 2 arrays with a particular structure.
        The arrays will:
        Be of equal size
        Will each contain some number (X) arrays
        Each inner array will contain that same number (X) primitive elements
        All the nested primitives within each array must strictly match to return a true result. Any mismatches will return false.
        For example:
    <pre>// each of these arrays have 3 nested arrays of 3 strings each 
        const arr1 = [['a','b','c'],['d','e','f'],['g','h','i']]
        const arr2 = [['a','b','c'],['d','e','f'],['g','h','i']]
        const arr3 = [['a','B','c'],['d','E','f'],['g','H','i']]
        const arr4 = [['a','b','c'],['g','h','i'],['d','e','f']]
        // if we were to use our function to compare all the possible pairs
        // ONLY arr1 vs arr2 would return true
        checkEquality(arr1, arr2) => true
        checkEquality(arr1, arr3) => false
        checkEquality(arr1, arr4) => false
        // etc.</pre>
        Good luck! Check back tomorrow for the next challenge of the week!</p>
